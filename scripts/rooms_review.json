We share a bathroom, which is something I would not want to do with any more than one roommate.  Freshman year, I was in a 7-guy suite with a shared bathroom, and it was GROSS.  Sharing a bathroom with just one other guy can work.  Basically, this room has an inner closet/hallway thing that connects the two singles (it's not considered a double because we  each have our own door to the main building hallway, and we each have our own phone number and address).  The closet/hallway/bathroom connector is really cool cuz you can pile lots of stuff in there and try to keep your bedroom relatively organized.  The absolute worst part of Scully is that it is so far from everything.  10 minute walk to Colonial Club.  Location is important to me, so this was definitely a drawback.  Still, everything considered, I was happy having Scully 152 for my senior year, given that I was connected to my best bud.",

Also, the ceiling is quite low--I have a loft, and I sleep about 2 feet away from the ceiling. I cannot sit up in bed, and I hit my head a LOT; if you draw into 312 Forbes, I would not recommend lofting your bed, even though you might want to in order to free up some space in this rather small room. Some positives are that the room has a great view of the golf course and two closets built into the wall (instead of the armoires that some rooms have). Also, the hallway-type space leading into the room is wide enough to put your dresser and/or fridge in, to free up some space in the main area of the room. All told, I have been fine living in 312 Forbes this year, but would have preferred most other doubles in the main inn over this one. ",

When I lived there, the heating was also extremely loud. I've been in rooms in Brown, Murray-Dodge that also have loud heating, but this was louder. The sound was more of a shrill high sound with big clunking sounds (I learned to sleep throught it).

I have 9 windows in my single. \r\n\r\nHousing in Bloomberg tends to have really crappy sound insulation because every door has about an inch and a half gap between it and the floor, but this problem is easily fixed by adding a little plastic strip on the bottom of the door.

Add to that a seriously oversized wardrobe, desk, bed, and dresser, and there's not much living space left.  Lofting the bed might be beneficial; I didn't try.  The high-set window opens out to the back landing of Blair Arch, so you will hear archsings and people can easily look into your room if the shade is not drawn.  Still, it's a Mathey single, which have historically been in short supply and high demand.  Some of these things I've pointed out as downsides may be upsides for different people.

You can easily fit 3-4 couches/futons in here. Moreover, because the staircase is \"unsupported,\" you can squeeze a dresser underneath it if you wish.

The people in the rooms facing 211 Gauss get some noise during party nights, but it hasn't ever been too much of an issue for me. There is an absolute ton of space in this suite, but a lot of dust collects around the suite, and with nine guys, the bathrooms tend to get dirty quickly. Moreover, at least at the beginning of the year, walking to the third floor every time you need something is annoying, although I hardly noticed it by October. \r\n\r\nHowever, having what is probably the third-biggest common room of any room on campus (trailing the Zoo and 211 Gauss) makes up for it.

We decided to double loft the beds in that room (with desks below) and it worked out great; i recommend it if you don't mind being in a lofted bed.  We then switched rooms mid-year as the other double is much larger and doesn't require any bunking/lofting.\r\n\r\nBy double lofting in the smaller room we freed up plenty of space in the common room which is fairly large and has a nice windowsill seat to go along with it.  134 is one of the best locations on campus, with a nice overlook of the junior slums on one side and Dillon gym on the other.  The 13th entryway is right outside the main entrance to Dillon which is pretty convenient, as is the nearby printer/laundry room in the underground level.

Scully is also a great building--relatively new, and with a lot of nice features, like self-controlled air conditioning and heating.  I especially liked this room, too, since it's right next door to the lounge (with TV), kitchen (partial, not full: microwave and instant hot water spout, no oven or stovetop), study room with nice tables (good place to work), and print release station (just down the hall = SO convenient).  The room is also right by the elevator, which makes moving in and getting to your room super easy.  Note that the third floor of Scully is all connected, whereas the first and second floors aren't--I think this actually makes the third floor of Scully a more desirable place to live than the second floor because of how easily you can get between sections of the building.  Laundry is also close by: either up one floor (directly above you) or down two floors (right below the print release station).  And, if your roommate is hogging the bathroom, there's a bathroom right next door to you (next to the elevator) and the bathrooms on the fourth floor also have additional showers and stalls.  The proximity to the elevator and lounge do not present any noise problems.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the room itself, it's pretty nice.  The L-shape is a little strange to get used to at first, since the closet is nailed down right next to the door.  However, my roommate and I had quite different setups, and both worked really well: I managed to fit my bed, desk, side table, couch, and bookshelves without a problem, whereas he set up a bit more sparsely, with the furniture that comes with the room + a big lounge chair with footrest.  His setup (the sparser variety) left a LOT of floor space to work with; mine was nice since I had a couch.  You could probably pull off a futon with the bed, too, although this does cut into your floor space.\r\n\r\nThe room has a huge window that looks out over Poe Field, which is beautiful, along with high ceilings.  318 is slightly different from most of the other rooms in this part of Scully in that the window ledge is rectangular (as opposed to having the triangular window that sticks out, which I think every other room has).  This means your window is one long flat piece of glass as opposed to two panels that are concave...Though a little bit different at first, and perhaps hard if you're planning on putting a TV there, it's a great shelf and quite easy to put your desk by the window and look out on the beautiful weather outside you.\r\n\r\nHaving your own bathroom is of course a huge plus, too.\r\n\r\nPick this room with a roommate you like, but want to have your own space with too.

However, that makes it all more cozier, and it is still pretty comfortable.  If you're a guy, the bathroom is right next door, which has been really convenient.  The main drawback is its proximity to Blair Arch.  I've had problems with people who walk right up to my window and start talking loudly on cell phones.  It offers a pretty good view of the U-store courtyard, as most Blair singles are obscured by the U-Store wall.  Its proximity to the elevator and Blair Arch entrance make moving/entering that much easier too.  All in all, it's not a bad room, especially for a Mathey single.",

Second, the shape of the room is like an L, so both beds can fit in a nook off by themselves, no need to keep them bunked. So it's really more like a 2-room suite than a 1-room double. The dimensions are 7'x11' and 16'x18'. Third, you're at the top of the entryway, on the far side of a fire door from everyone else on the floor, so it's never noisy. Fourth, (If you're a girl) it's right across the hall from a women's bathroom, which it shares with only 3 other rooms. If you're a guy, it's two flights down to the men's room. For either sex, you can get to a print cluster without going outside, which is nice.\r\nPossible downsides: 2.5 flights of stairs.

I think it's definitely worth the extra couple of flights up, especially if you like some peace and quiet.  The room is in the corner of the building on the opposite side of the hall from the rest of the rooms, so on the other side of your walls you don't have any neighbors--check the maps to see what I mean.

Superior location on campus, being so close to Frist and Dillon.\r\n\r\nCons: The entire 3rd floor is infested by centipedes and you will definitely have some 'interesting' moments trying to deal with them. I've heard an average of ~10 will visit you throughout the year, if you're alert enough to notice them. Housing can't do anything about it, you just have to deal with them. The building itself is quite old. There are a good amount of stairs to reach the 3rd floor, which some people intensely dislike. The window leaks on heavier rains; other rooms in 1939 have the same problem. The heat system makes a LOT of noise when it comes on (as in almost all rooms in the building) but you get used to it.\r\n\r\nOverall: Great room and location, the only reason I chose 4/5 instead of 5/5 was the centipede problem.",

You have to drag your dirty clothes over to Dodd or 1903 to do your laundry.  Another thing to keep in mind is that the Brown Co-op is just down the hall.

I built my bed into the window-seat, which I strongly recommend doing--it really opens up the room, making both the window-seat and the main part of the room more accessible: you end up with a living room, bedroom, and dressing room area.\r\n\r\nPros:  Fireplace, bay window, huge size, right next to elevator, great view, right by women's restroom, lounge and print release station on the same floor, laundry room straight downstairs via elevator, neat nooks and crannies, great location, relatively new building, beautiful sunlight streaming through window-seat window in morning (perfect angle!)\r\n\r\nCons:  Wardrobe rather than closet, space a little difficult to arrange, but great once you get it set up, men's bathroom downstairs or way down the hall (we shared the women's)...\r\n\r\nDefinitely a great room!",

The guys I was drawing with all wanted singles (as did I), and even though we didn't have a terrible draw time (middle of the second day), none of the up campus rooms that we could have drawn into were terribly great. The quads were all small and all the singles were located all over the place. That being said, Scully 2 room doubles have a lot going for them. You have ample space in your room and you get your own private bathroom to share with your roommate as well. There is a little bit of hall space for when you enter the double and then doors leading to each person's individual room. You'll have a toilet and sink to one side of the hall space and a shower and sink on the other. The hall space is big enough that you'll have space for a fridge or shoe rack or crates or whatever else you might like. \r\n\r\nOne of the great things about scully is the air conditioning. At the beginning and end of the year, while all your friends are sitting around sweating in their rooms, you get to be cool and dry. Also, there's a lot of study rooms scattered throughout the building, so if you need to work on a problem set with other people, you can get them to come down to you rather than trudging your way over to frist or the library. Did I mention that the laundry machines and print cluster are just a floor down from 368? Unlike a lot of other laundry rooms on campus, the laundry room here usually isn't terribly busy. So the days of walking through the rain 2 buildings over with your 3 weeks worth of laundry only to find that none of the machines are available are over. \r\n\r\nAs for the downside, there are no common rooms really in scully, which means no big parties really. But that's what up campus is for, right? Also, despite having hallways, scully just isn't a terribly lively place. On the flipside, if you're looking for a room that will be fairly quiet, this is it. Finally, scully really does put some physical distance between you and your friends who might live further up campus. At least you're probably just as far away from classes and the street as all of them. The only difference is that you get a little extra exercise trekking up hill.\r\n\r\nSo on the whole scully 368 and any of the 2 room doubles in scully aren't really a bad place to spend your junior year. You get all the benefits of a single and all the comforts of a relatively new building. Enjoy. ",

In fact, I wasn't even able to use the loft because there wasn't enough room on either end.  Also, only one person could fit in the skinny hallway part of the room at one time, so moving my stuff in and out was a pain in the neck.  The walls were really thin and the year I lived in it, there were two drummers next door.  Also, the room is kind of isolated and set apart from the main hallway, which I guess could be a good thing, but I would prefer a more social environment.  Witherspoon is a great building in a good location, which are probably the only positives of this room.  I don't understand why they continue to place Special Needs kids in this room.",

The cinder block walls do not block out noise from the lounge and bathroom it is next to, meaning you will be privy to \"rousing\" 3am conversations from people back from the street, or people who would rather not inconvenience and impose their cellphone conversations on their roommates so they do it to you instead. The heat to the room stopped working before the start of winter so HVAC had to provide me with a radiator.\r\nDespite the small size and the external closet, it can accommodate the provided furniture comfortably under the right arrangement. But don't expect to fit in much more than a minifridge. The window gets lots of sun during the day and provides a good view of the quad below, which could be a negative next year since it it my understanding that landscaping work will be performed on it (who knows how long or noisy it will be).\r\nUnless you can convince some of your friends to take up a double or two on the 4th floor, you'll be living with freshmen and be a bit isolated from friends in the annex or main inn. But hey, this is still Forbes so you get laundry/print station/dining hall/kitchen/mailbox access without going outside, and carpeted floors. Then again, saying \"at least it isn't Butler\" will no longer apply meaning you're officially in the worst dorm on campus, Enjoy!",

My room is on the south side of the building and I slept with my window open every single night.  The best feature of 408 is that it has 5 bedrooms; i.e. 4 singles.  The room is pretty much highly symmetrical; the four singles are essentially identical and the common room and the double are as well.\r\n\r\nThe singles are by no means huge, but are quite sufficient to live comfortably.  Also, we didn't have an issue with too-thin walls.  I found them adequate; you're more liable to hear through the standard dorm doors than the walls.  The double is somewhat unusually shaped, but is pretty big.  As stated in the previous review, the common room is somewhat small for 6, but we made do just fine and fit in many more on two futons--I think putting the TV(s) in the fireplace area maximizes the number of seats.\r\n\r\n408 was also great for parties given the number of rooms and hallway.  The only issue we had with the room was that the room overlooks Elm, such that it  is easy for Public Safety to hear parties, but they were always pretty chill.\r\n\r\nBasically, if you're looking for a 5-bedroom 6-man, 408 is your best bet in Patton; it's got some extra square feet on the other 5-bedroom one, and plus there's a laundry machine right around the corner.",

The pair in the double on the lower level of the suite should be people who go to sleep the latest and who don't mind noise because it opens out right into the common room.\r\n2. If you're reading this review as a pre-frosh, try to figure out who's rooming with whom before getting on campus. It makes moving in a lot easier if everyone already knows who their roommate is and which room they're going to live in. Plus, this way you'll avoid any roommate incompatabilities later in the year. This worked out so well for us that all three of the double pairs in this suite are staying with their roommate for next year. \r\n3. Lighting is pretty terrible. Be prepared to buy lamps, lots of them.\r\n4. It'll take trial and error to figure out a cleaning schedule that works. Be patient with one another.\r\n\r\nAll in all, rejoice if you get this suite.

The other bedroom feels like prison: bunked beds, one desk, one dresser... and let me tell you, having your desk or dresser in the common room is a royal pain in the ass!\r\n\r\nBesides that? Adjustable heat that works is a plus! Amazing view of the courtyard! Fabulous bay window! And the common room is very, very spacious. We had a nice little soiree that was able to host in excess of 30 people. This room can be tons of fun, in the right hands, and with the right roomates. I will say this much, I consider myself to have been a lucky freshman. I will always remember what great memories I formed here in 116 Blair.\r\n\r\nOh, one other point...\r\nThis room INVARIABLY becomes a social hub for your neighbors on the 3rd floor. So one other issue to combat is constant mess. We had an issue with people being bums in our room. Still, it was sort of fun.\r\n\r\nOverall: great times, great memories, great year!",

Even though the room's lighting is more natural than the residential college yellow light, I still found a lamp to be good for the afternoons and evenings. It is a very clean building in general and new so you don't have to worry about bugs. 330 is a great location on the 3rd floor: garbage disposal is at one end of the hall, computer cluster is at the other end, and the elevator is somewhere in between, which means moving in and out is simple.\r\n\r\nA note about 330 itself: the previous resident really went to town on the walls and there are a lot of holes, pencil markings and stains on the walls. It is bearable but something to cover it all up is nice.\r\n\r\nOne thing for non-science majors: the main part of campus is all uphill so whether you go to Frist, McCosh or Firestone, it can get annoying when it's hot and humid. Also, since it's removed from the main part of campus, forgetting your prox late at night can be an issue because only scully people will come around.\r\n\r\nBut overall this is a great room. It's very quiet and the semi-private bath is great, as is walking in to a cool room on a hot day. If you're a science major whose buildings are down campus, this room is perfect.",

		"content" : "Overall, this room is OK, although its designation as a triple in the 2007-08 year was not a great idea.  It will probably suffice as a double in 2008-09.\r\n\r\nThe common room is quite large and can comfortably fit 3 desks, 3 drawers, a couch, a fridge, and a TV (which we stuffed into the fireplace).  Definitely capable of large parties if you're into it.  Walls are made of concrete/stone and not too susceptible to nailing.  Lighting isn't too great despite windows on 2 walls, because of the way the room is oriented.  Heating (like in most of the slums) is by hand adjusting valves on wall-side boilers.\r\n\r\nThe real issue is that the bedroom is TINY -- as a triple this year, we could not fit the 3rd bed in the room even after bunking 2 beds, and the 3rd roommate had to resort to piling up mattresses stolen from the hallway.  It'll work much better as a double, although the dimensions of the room compared to the bed frames would still require either bunking or moving one bed into the common room.  There is one built-in closet in the bedroom, and 2 out in the common room.\r\n\r\nThere is a private bathroom accessible only by walking through the bedroom.  It works fine other than the occasional drainage problem (Housing responded within the day when I called them up).  Although the little bathroom window is located directly beneath the Henry-Foulke archway, which enables eavesdropping during showers.\r\n\r\nThe room is directly across the hall from an a capella group (the Tigerlilies).  Rehearsals are not loud enough to be annoying, although be prepared for their partying during the post-audition, pre-break, and pre-holiday seasons.  Something kind of unsettling is that there are rows of bike racks directly outside the windows of both the common room and bedroom -- when people deposit their bikes, it often feels like they're about to break into the room.",

If you take this room, I would highly recommend putting your desk in front of the window and the bed by the door because it opens up the space a lot.

One window we've kept covered with a Pace (Italian for \"peace\") flag so our activities in the room aren't constantly on display. The other window isn't at eye-level so we get a beautiful view, but no one looking in. \r\n  There is no better location on campus. We're first floor, so moving in is a snap. We're closer to Frist than we are to Wilson. There's a computer cluster in nearby 1937. Best of all, laundry is just one flight of stairs down. Being central campus and at the intersection of so many roads, 101 Feinberg is also a great place to meet people, and we have lots of friends stop by the room just because it is on their way to and/or from class, activities, etc.\r\n  The room on the right has significantly more natural light, so if this is a major consideration, keep that in mind. Also, your computers will need to be wireless. The ethernet ports are in strange locations and may not work with the layout you want of the room.\r\n  The one reservation I have about this room is noise. You will get noise of people walking back from the street. Also, Feinberg is a great place for parties, so don't draw into this room if you expect your neighbors to be completely quiet on a Saturday night. Also, the heaters are water heaters that have a propensity for clanking. It worked out great for us because we're all deep sleepers. We weren't bothered by the noise. This is especially important because it sort of defeats the purpose of having such a great common room if one roommate needs absolute quiet when sleeping. If you're a very private person and can't stand the idea of people being able to see into your common room, then it might not be a such a great idea to draw into this room, either.\r\n  However, what are the other perks of this room? Well, there's the prox entry for one. You won't have to carry an extra key with you, you can just prox in! The private bathroom (just make sure you guys are willing to clean it). And, for the 2008-2009 year, your RCAs will be right downstairs in the Fishbowl, so free food and lots of fun whenever you want!\r\n  In all seriousness, visit and see for yourselves.

It's small, cramped, awkwardly shaped, and wraps around an elevator shaft on the first story of the building. When you add desks and beds, there's almost no room left. Because it's right next to the elevator shaft everyone uses, you're going to hear everyone who uses it, including the drunk frat guys at 3:00 AM and the sketchy guy in the basement who eats paper and likes to sing wherever he goes. If you like to have your own chairs/random appliances, good luck finding space for them. Long story short, basically every moment you spend in this room will be sheer agony. If you have the misfortune to get this room, I advise you to spend as much time as possible out of it, because, frankly, you'd have a better experience with a tent on Alexander Beach than in this thing.",

		"content" : "1. This room, being in Joline, is not on par in terms of interior quality with more modern, renovated dorms such as those in Blair, Little, and Hamilton. It has no thermostat, so you'll be completely dependent on the whim of the central heating system, which is excessive in the winter (and loud!). Because it is in the attic (basically), the air quality isn't spectacular -- it is still and somewhat stuffy. While you can alleviate that by opening the window, doing so will invite a consistent stream of bugs into the room. I also noticed a large insect (perhaps a centipede) almost enter the room through the radiator, so I had to seal it up with duct tape.\r\n\r\n2. In terms of noise, the walls are thick and the room is reasonably quiet, even on party nights.\r\n\r\n3. The bathrooms are close by, but they have extremely poor ventilation, and are inconsistently maintained by the janitor. Although they are better than those found in the basement, they are mediocre compared to the spacious and well-ventilated ones found in buildings like Blair.\r\n\r\n4. My roommate and I organized the dorm into two bedrooms, rather than a bedroom and a common room. This arrangement worked great -- although the inner room is very small, it fits everything you need without a problem (bed, desk, refrigerator, bookshelf, television, closet, etc.).\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, if you are drawing in Mathey and would like a two-room double, I strongly recommend 231 Joline. Otherwise, there are better options, especially outside of Mathey (e.g. Scully). Thus, while the room is good, I simply cannot recommend it when compared to the many other options that are significantly superior.",

The room directly above this one has the exact same layout, and they were able to fit two lovely couches, a TV and coffee table, a card table, a lounge chair, and four smaller table chairs all in this area without it feeling cramped at all. The bedrooms are on the smaller side, so it is difficult to unbunk the beds (but possible, especially if the desks are moved into the common room). The walls are really thick so everything is quiet, and I couldn't hear anything from my neighbors in the building. On occasion, the noise outside the bedroom window (facing 1903) could get a little louder as people walked by on Thursday and Saturday nights, but I'm a really light sleeper and it hardly bothered me. It also has real closets! The courtyard is pretty, and obviously Cuyler has a great location. The downside is that laundry and printer are both in different buildings. 1903's basement laundry room has a rather treacherous stairway outside in the winter, and the printer in Brown was often broken so I usually used the one in Wright. Also, both men's and women's bathrooms are in the basement, but this room is much closer to both than most other rooms in Cuyler, especially the women's. Overall, it was a fantastic room, and I definitely recommend it.",

The floor plan is identical, but it's listed as 503 sq. ft. compared to the 451 for this room.  Basically, the 451 is the total usable space, without the hallway inside the room and the closets.\r\n\r\nThe room itself is great. 1903's location alone makes it worth it, and the common room is pretty spacious.  The room looks over Prospect Garden, so it's quieter overall than the courtyard rooms, although it can still get kind of loud when people are coming back from the Street (though that's true of almost every room in this part of campus).\r\n\r\nThe biggest downside is that there are only two bedrooms, and the double is a little cramped.  There's not enough room to debunk the beds, and there's only one closet in the bedroom, so you'll either have to share or have one person use the third closet in the room's hallway.  You'll also have to have the two desks for the people who live in the double in the common room, though it's large enough that this isn't a problem.  The heat only has two settings (off and hellfire), so you'll probably have to keep your windows open all winter, but again, not really a big deal.\r\n\r\nThere's a women's bathroom right next door, and for the men's room, you can either go up or down a flight of stairs or down the hall to the 2nd entryway.  1903 has a laundry room in the basement.\r\n\r\nWe got this room during mixed-class draw last year.

I used to have a small ant problem, but I hit the areas with insect repellant and haven't seen them since.  Some people may prefer a totally private bathroom, but shared is more convenient when you lock yourself out.\r\nMoral of the story: this is an awesome room.  Enjoy it while it lasts.",

Great to be close to study rooms and a printer, just upstairs from a kitchen and TV room.  Great location.",

Laundry room is right downstairs which is nice, and the Mathey Common Room is too (which is GREAT for getting in line for weekly study breaks or Broadway tickets early in the mornings).  Hamilton is connected to the RoMa Dining Hall so this winter when it was freeeeezing cold or there was 2 feet of snow on the ground, we didn't have to bundle up to walk to eat which was AMAZING. The only annoying thing is that the boys and girls bathrooms are upstairs but its not a dealbreaker. Thermostats in every room and great views of the Rocky tower from the common room. The Hamilton Courtyard is so peaceful and idyllic-we often see little rabbits running around and hear birds chirping, it feels like we are in a fairytale sometimes and when its warm outside, tons of couples take wedding pictures outside of your window. Hamilton is recently renovated too so the hallways are wood paneled and nice to come home too.\r\n\r\nIn summary, beautiful room, excellent location! I will definitely miss this room.",

The bedrooms are small but the location is really good - you can get to the dining hall without leaving cover so you don't need a coat if it's raining, the laundry room is literally right downstairs, etc. Bathrooms are either downstairs (guys' or girls') or one floor up (guys' only). \r\n\r\nCon:You can hear almost everything that goes on in the entryway from the common room. You also have to be careful about leaving your windows open when you're not around because the bedrooms face onto Nassau Street.\r\n\r\nOverall, freshmen, you'll enjoy having this room! ",

The other bad part about the smaller bedroom room is that there really isn't much of a closet. Both rooms have dressers with five drawers, but they're pretty shallow drawers. Eventually, you decide that you need to hang up some clothes...and then you see a small alcove divided into 2 parts with 2 closet rods. The rods are literally less than 1.5' per person. Try not to bring too much stuff if you can avoid it (plus it's three floors up - no elevator). The bigger bedroom has four closet rods a lot more space for clothing.\r\n\r\nThere's not much lighting either so be prepared to bring a bright desk lamp.\r\n\r\nIn general, the room is  pretty central in Wilson.

One of the bedrooms does have a bay window though, which is a nice place to put your desk. the common room is a good size, but it is awkwardly shaped. there are two fairly large closets, but there are only 3 bars for hanging clothes (2 in one and 1 in the other), so someone doesn't get to hang their clothes. Also, the closets are extremely awkwardly shaped and don't have any light source (and there are no outlets inside), so it's really hard to see inside when you're looking for something. On the topic of outlets, this room is SEVERELY lacking in outlets: each bedroom only has 1, and the common room only has 2 (on opposite sides of the room). We ended up using literally around a dozen extension cords to get everything plugged in in somewhere where it could be used. Also the room gets unbearably hot in the winter, and the windows must be left open basically all the time, except if you have your desk near a window, in which case no matter how much you close the window it's still going to be freezing because the windows are very poorly insulated. The floors are also in really bad condition, with large gaps between some of the tiles--stuff (e.g. vomit) gets stuck in them and are really hard to get out. The room is quite far from bathrooms: you either have to go up one flight of stairs and down a long hallway to use a tiny, poorly ventilated, rarely cleaned bathroom, or down two flights of stairs to use a larger basement bathroom that is perpetually in a state of sustained filth. Basically, avoid this room like the plague.\r\n\r\nIt is however a decent party room, since it is quite far from the RCA room (on a different floor and down a long hallway) and is already in terrible condition so parties can't make it any worse anyway.

I decided not to loft my bed and ended up with about 4 square feet of personal space, since I also needed to find a place for my dresser. I didn't mind, but most other people would probably want a different arrangement (say, lofting both beds or not debunking).\r\n\r\nAmazing common room more than makes up for it, though. Possibly the biggest common room I've seen on campus (with the exclusion of the other 4 turret rooms).\r\n\r\nBiggest downside is that you must climb 4 flights of stairs or wait for the elevator to get to your room",

There's a little nook you can shove your dresser into but that's about it. I put my bed on risers (but not lofted) and was able to cram my fridge, laundry, and other stuff under it, good space saver. The room can also get quite hot, but opening the window usually takes care of that (hope you don't have allergies). Lighting is not great at all, but the window actually lets in quite a bit of light and if you bring a lamp you'll be fine. The only other non-size related issue with it goes along with proximity to the bathroom -- the stalls next door are super spring-loaded, so although you can't hear people going to the bathroom or anything (thank god), if people let the doors slam back it will often bounce several times and shake the walls in the process.\r\n\r\nOverall,\r\n\r\nPROS: LOCATION, proximity to newly renovated bathrooms, laundry/printer in building, kitchen down the hall, big ENOUGH to live in but not to do much else\r\n\r\nCONS: size and shape, slamming bathroom doors, dim lighting, gets pretty hot without window\r\n\r\nrecommendation: get this room and be close to friends with a triple or quad next door, and get the janitor to clip a couple of springs on those stupid bathroom doors",

In that sense it was a \"walk-through\" closet.  Each side (one for each of us) had a long hanging rod, a shelf up above, and was deep enough to stash stuff easily (the shelf was high and thus perfect for rarely accessed storage).  The bathroom was nice (I mean who can complain about a private bath?), and I particularly enjoyed the fact that it featured a tub, not just a shower stall.  Another nice thing; it had a REAL glass mirror, not one of those polished metal failed attempts at a mirror.\r\n\r\nI think this room is usually assigned to freshman, but if it is ever up for draw, definitely consider it if you want a reasonably spacious (there are definitely bigger out there) double in a nice location with a good private bathroom.",

The triple upstairs 122 is hardwood but shaped differently. \r\nBeautiful window seat extends entire length of wall. \r\nGirls bathroom is just down the stairs, boys down the stairs a bit down the hall. \r\nBit of a roach problem, like lots of upperclassman housing, but itll just hone your reflexes. \r\nNo garbage dumpsters outside windows. \r\nGreat triple for junior year. \r\n",

We bunked our beds, but it is still difficult to navigate the room. The window faces the north, which means you get no natural light and the room is very dim. The awkward position of the window and placement of the fire sprinklers meant that there was only one place in the room where our bed could go. Also, we couldn't put stuff on top of our closets because of the sprinklers. Oh, and dump trucks come every morning to wake you up. You can also hear everything your neighbors are saying through the walls...Thank god I had a lovely roommate who also kept things very clean—otherwise I would have gone insane.

Put a round table in there and you can seat 15 people cozily for poker night without having taken up any actual room space...\r\n\r\n-There are a lot of windows which will help keep the room drafty during the warm months, but on the colder side during the winter, especially the turret, which has poor insulation.\r\n-The bedrooms are extremely narrow, so any efforts to try and debunk would not be worth it.\r\n-Furniture placement is very key to making this room the best it can be. There is an awkward fireplace mantle that can prevent this.\r\n-There are a lot of house centipedes during the warm months. They usually disappear by late October and this is common to most Rocky rooms if not more.\r\n-Noise from the music room: the room rests on top of the music room in the basement and you are guaranteed to hear whatever plays down there. However, I personally have not had a problem with it in the bedroom and attempting to sleep.\r\n-Noise from the dumpster: EVERY morning, the dump truck comes by around 9:30-11:00 am to empty the dumpsters on the side of Witherspoon. This involves a good 5-10 minutes of loud metal clashing and banging. If you are not a heavy sleeper, this is your alarm clock because the dumpster is right there\r\n-Visibility: with the curtains up, most adjacent 03 quads can see what's up in your room\r\n-Being on the first floor is quite convenient for the printer, kitchen, and exits\r\n-Bathrooms: in the 2014-2015 year, the adjacent bathroom was women's and unfortunately we (men) were not able to change it, so we had to walk across the hall to use the bathroom\r\n\r\nAll that being said, if you are being faced with the choice between this last turret room and ANY other quad in Rocky, I strongly advise that you pick this room.",

It's really nice. Some noise from the junior slums can be heard at night, depending on how much partying is going on.

It's not a big desk area, but these days with computers you don't really need a big space to write an essay, cause you can have everything you need on your laptop.\r\nSome of the perks are there's a great lounge nearby on  this floor which makes for a great time hanging out with your floor-mates and your RCA. \r\nThe view in this room is also really nice. \r\nIt's a small room, but I think if you have a good relationship with your roommate, you'll be fine. I think it helps when you're willing to do stuff like studying at the library at least part of the time when your roommate is watching TV or vice versa. \r\nAlso, you're close to Nassau Street and Dillon Gym and the dining area. \r\nI feel like you gotta have good communication with your roommate in a room like this.

The slums are noisy on Thursday and Saturday nights, but the noise isn't bad otherwise.

That meant that we ended up with one huge single, but that room also shares a very thin wall with the common room, which can get kind of loud from time to time. We kept all the desks from the doubles in the common room, which took a little bit of arranging, but ended up being pretty good. The doubles were comfortable (no way you can have debunked bed and desks in there though - we debunked, but kept desks outside). \r\n\r\nThere is a little balcony/emergency exit that we're not \"supposed\" to use, but its really nice. The bathroom got kind of disgusting from time to time, so just make sure you have a good cleaning schedule - we didn't. Great room for pregames and we all became really good friends, so overall I had a great experience! ",
