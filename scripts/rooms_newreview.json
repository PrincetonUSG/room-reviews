We share a bathroom, which is something I would not want to do with any more than one roommate.  Freshman year, I was in a 7-guy suite with a shared bathroom, and it was GROSS.  Sharing a bathroom with just one other guy can work.  Basically, this room has an inner closet/hallway thing that connects the two singles (it's not considered a double because we  each have our own door to the main building hallway, and we each have our own phone number and address).  The closet/hallway/bathroom connector is really cool cuz you can pile lots of stuff in there and try to keep your bedroom relatively organized.  The absolute worst part of Scully is that it is so far from everything.  10 minute walk to Colonial Club.  Location is important to me, so this was definitely a drawback.  Still, everything considered, I was happy having Scully 152 for my senior year, given that I was connected to my best bud.",

Also, the ceiling is quite low--I have a loft, and I sleep about 2 feet away from the ceiling. I cannot sit up in bed, and I hit my head a LOT; if you draw into 312 Forbes, I would not recommend lofting your bed, even though you might want to in order to free up some space in this rather small room. Some positives are that the room has a great view of the golf course and two closets built into the wall (instead of the armoires that some rooms have). Also, the hallway-type space leading into the room is wide enough to put your dresser and/or fridge in, to free up some space in the main area of the room.

When I lived there, the heating was also extremely loud. I've been in rooms in Brown, Murray-Dodge that also have loud heating, but this was louder. The sound was more of a shrill high sound with big clunking sounds (I learned to sleep throught it). The Forbes addition is also more disconnected from the rest of Forbes (and farther away from campus, although once you make it to Forbes, I don't think the difference is that great).\r\n\r\nI would highly recommend this room to those who are looking for a quiet space, like to wake up to the morning sun, and enjoy the single life (living with friends nearby is also a way to have the best of the social and solitary worlds).",

The windows are huge. I have 9 windows in my single. \r\n\r\nHousing in Bloomberg tends to have really crappy sound insulation because every door has about an inch and a half gap between it and the floor, but this problem is easily fixed by adding a little plastic strip on the bottom of the door. This has been done for the doors in 381.\r\n\r\nYou should know that the showers in 381, 281, 181, and 481 are all on a different waterline from the rest of Bloomberg, which results in our occasionally having to wait upwards of 15 minutes for the hot water to arrive in our shower. In addition, the water pressure generally sucks.\r\n\r\nI personally am a huge fan of Bloomberg as a dorm; I firmly believe the insides of Bloomberg make it easily the best dorm on campus. The one thing about it is, of course, the location. The rooms are spacious, beautiful, bug-free, and well-lit; the windows are large and plentiful (the quads mentioned above all have two rooms each with two walls of windows in each room - I watch the sunrise from my bed every morning, and it's spectacular), and the dorm itself is literally 3 minutes' walk away form the molecular biology buildings.

It's just that the room is really, really small and the furniture probably can't be moved.  122 square feet may seem like a lot (that's the size of a standard Butler single) but the room is sort of L-shaped, so a lot of that space is taken up by the door and entry to the room.  Add to that a seriously oversized wardrobe, desk, bed, and dresser, and there's not much living space left.  Lofting the bed might be beneficial; I didn't try.  The high-set window opens out to the back landing of Blair Arch, so you will hear archsings and people can easily look into your room if the shade is not drawn.  Still, it's a Mathey single, which have historically been in short supply and high demand.  Some of these things I've pointed out as downsides may be upsides for different people.  By the way, bathrooms, laundry, and the Blair \"cafe\" are on the same floor.  Also, the room is the one nearest the elevator, for easy move-in.  And, as you probably know, the building was renovated in the recent past.",

The outlet and ethernet are on opposite walls, so you've got to find a way to rig it that Public Safety won't complain about.

On the bottom floor (the 3rd floor of 1939), there is a huge common room with a sweeping view of the Wilson quad on one side and a small window facing out over Wilcox on the other. You can easily fit 3-4 couches/futons in here. Moreover, because the staircase is \"unsupported,\" you can squeeze a dresser underneath it if you wish.  There is also a bathroom branching off of the common room (which you will need to clean yourself), a room we used as a rather small double, and a decently-sized single.\r\n\r\nUpstairs, there is another bathroom, which also needs to be cleaned, a gigantic double with a great view of the Wilson quad, another rather large double with a kind of bad view of Gauss/Whitman, and two singles, one which looks out on Wilcox, another which looks out Gauss.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I have enjoyed living here this year. The people in the rooms facing 211 Gauss get some noise during party nights, but it hasn't ever been too much of an issue for me. There is an absolute ton of space in this suite, but a lot of dust collects around the suite, and with nine guys, the bathrooms tend to get dirty quickly. Moreover, at least at the beginning of the year, walking to the third floor every time you need something is annoying, although I hardly noticed it by October. \r\n\r\nHowever, having what is probably the third-biggest common room of any room on campus (trailing the Zoo and 211 Gauss) makes up for it. This room has been sub-free for the last two years and will probably remain so into the foreseeable future. We had a somewhat mediocre draw time in Wilson sub-free draw and still got the room, so go for it!",

We decided to double loft the beds in that room (with desks below) and it worked out great; i recommend it if you don't mind being in a lofted bed.  We then switched rooms mid-year as the other double is much larger and doesn't require any bunking/lofting.\r\n\r\nBy double lofting in the smaller room we freed up plenty of space in the common room which is fairly large and has a nice windowsill seat to go along with it.  134 is one of the best locations on campus, with a nice overlook of the junior slums on one side and Dillon gym on the other.  The 13th entryway is right outside the main entrance to Dillon which is pretty convenient, as is the nearby printer/laundry room in the underground level.  There are two bathrooms on the same floor as 134, both about 20 feet away (highly convenient).  While there is a dumpster on the slums side of the room, it is not particularly loud and I've only noticed it being unloaded in late morning.\r\n\r\n134 is definitely an excellent quad if you're fine living in a loft (i never had, and i didn't mind it).",

		"content" : "I really enjoyed living in Scully 318.  Though it's a little bit far from the main part of campus, you get used to the walk pretty easily.  Scully is also a great building--relatively new, and with a lot of nice features, like self-controlled air conditioning and heating.  I especially liked this room, too, since it's right next door to the lounge (with TV), kitchen (partial, not full: microwave and instant hot water spout, no oven or stovetop), study room with nice tables (good place to work), and print release station (just down the hall = SO convenient).  The room is also right by the elevator, which makes moving in and getting to your room super easy.  Note that the third floor of Scully is all connected, whereas the first and second floors aren't--I think this actually makes the third floor of Scully a more desirable place to live than the second floor because of how easily you can get between sections of the building.  Laundry is also close by: either up one floor (directly above you) or down two floors (right below the print release station).  And, if your roommate is hogging the bathroom, there's a bathroom right next door to you (next to the elevator) and the bathrooms on the fourth floor also have additional showers and stalls.  The proximity to the elevator and lounge do not present any noise problems.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the room itself, it's pretty nice.  The L-shape is a little strange to get used to at first, since the closet is nailed down right next to the door.  However, my roommate and I had quite different setups, and both worked really well: I managed to fit my bed, desk, side table, couch, and bookshelves without a problem, whereas he set up a bit more sparsely, with the furniture that comes with the room + a big lounge chair with footrest.  His setup (the sparser variety) left a LOT of floor space to work with; mine was nice since I had a couch.  You could probably pull off a futon with the bed, too, although this does cut into your floor space.\r\n\r\nThe room has a huge window that looks out over Poe Field, which is beautiful, along with high ceilings.  318 is slightly different from most of the other rooms in this part of Scully in that the window ledge is rectangular (as opposed to having the triangular window that sticks out, which I think every other room has).  This means your window is one long flat piece of glass as opposed to two panels that are concave...Though a little bit different at first, and perhaps hard if you're planning on putting a TV there, it's a great shelf and quite easy to put your desk by the window and look out on the beautiful weather outside you.\r\n\r\nHaving your own bathroom is of course a huge plus, too.\r\n\r\nPick this room with a roommate you like, but want to have your own space with too.  A great room for junior draw--and if I had gotten a bad time in senior draw, I would have seriously considered living here again!  ",

Also, the window is in the slanted ceiling and faces north and so there is little light that enters the room although the other lighting in the room is particularly good.

I think it's definitely worth the extra couple of flights up, especially if you like some peace and quiet.  The room is in the corner of the building on the opposite side of the hall from the rest of the rooms, so on the other side of your walls you don't have any neighbors--check the maps to see what I mean.  And the bathrooms (both men's and women's) are really convenient, just right across the hall.\r\n\r\nGenerally the room is just a little bit quirky, but in a good way.  The door is offset from the main room, and there's a step up right when you enter.  The ceiling is sloped on two sides, but it's pretty high and doesn't make the room feel cramped at all.  The two windows on perpendicular walls give the room lots of natural light.  I find that there's something nice about living in a room that's not just a boring rectangular box.",

Lots of closet space (it is an OPEN closet though, not like some of the other closets in 1939). Heat is controllable. Antonio, 1939's janitor, is one of the most responsible and overall nicest people on campus. Bathrooms on every floor, so no need to trek down to the basement at 3 am. Superior location on campus, being so close to Frist and Dillon.\r\n\r\nCons: The entire 3rd floor is infested by centipedes and you will definitely have some 'interesting' moments trying to deal with them. I've heard an average of ~10 will visit you throughout the year, if you're alert enough to notice them. Housing can't do anything about it, you just have to deal with them. The building itself is quite old. There are a good amount of stairs to reach the 3rd floor, which some people intensely dislike. The window leaks on heavier rains; other rooms in 1939 have the same problem. The heat system makes a LOT of noise when it comes on (as in almost all rooms in the building) but you get used to it.\r\n\r\nOverall: Great room and location, the only reason I chose 4/5 instead of 5/5 was the centipede problem.",

It's a hike to the slums--but that's why they're the slums!\r\n\r\n1903 tends to be a great, social area, thanks to its central location and lovely courtyard.  But 332 faces OUT (towards Frist straight ahead, Prospect Garden to the left and Wilson to the right) which is wonderful when the frat boys and club pick-ups get really loud in the courtyard.  \r\n\r\n332 is a slightly isolated room in that it's at the top of a stairwell, directly across from a double and next to a bathroom, but not really on a proper hall.  Depending on your taste, this can be great.  I happen to like it a lot.  \r\n\r\n2 flights up is a cinch and there's always a bathroom nearby (directly next door or one flight down).  \r\n\r\nThe room itself is nice and spacious.  I've had gatherings of about 10 people here with ample space to move and even dance a little!  Enough room for the furniture they give you, plus a fridge and a 4-seater couch, plus various other small items. \r\n\r\nThe lighting is rather dim, but that's not much different from most dorms. \r\n\r\nI give this room 2 thumbs up!  \r\n\r\nKnow that you have to go outside to do laundry (not far) and that at least half of the machines have been broken all year despite numerous complaints.

The guys I was drawing with all wanted singles (as did I), and even though we didn't have a terrible draw time (middle of the second day), none of the up campus rooms that we could have drawn into were terribly great. The quads were all small and all the singles were located all over the place. That being said, Scully 2 room doubles have a lot going for them. You have ample space in your room and you get your own private bathroom to share with your roommate as well. There is a little bit of hall space for when you enter the double and then doors leading to each person's individual room. You'll have a toilet and sink to one side of the hall space and a shower and sink on the other. The hall space is big enough that you'll have space for a fridge or shoe rack or crates or whatever else you might like. \r\n\r\nOne of the great things about scully is the air conditioning. At the beginning and end of the year, while all your friends are sitting around sweating in their rooms, you get to be cool and dry. Also, there's a lot of study rooms scattered throughout the building, so if you need to work on a problem set with other people, you can get them to come down to you rather than trudging your way over to frist or the library. Did I mention that the laundry machines and print cluster are just a floor down from 368? Unlike a lot of other laundry rooms on campus, the laundry room here usually isn't terribly busy. So the days of walking through the rain 2 buildings over with your 3 weeks worth of laundry only to find that none of the machines are available are over. \r\n\r\nAs for the downside, there are no common rooms really in scully, which means no big parties really. But that's what up campus is for, right? Also, despite having hallways, scully just isn't a terribly lively place. On the flipside, if you're looking for a room that will be fairly quiet, this is it. Finally, scully really does put some physical distance between you and your friends who might live further up campus. At least you're probably just as far away from classes and the street as all of them. The only difference is that you get a little extra exercise trekking up hill.\r\n\r\nSo on the whole scully 368 and any of the 2 room doubles in scully aren't really a bad place to spend your junior year. You get all the benefits of a single and all the comforts of a relatively new building. Enjoy. ",

And DO does indeed have a little ant problem.\r\n\r\nBut this is all missing the point. When else in your life will you have the chance to live with NINE other guys in the same room? Probably never. So do it now. If you're lucky enough to get one of the singles, you'll have plenty of personal space for when you need it. But nothing can beat being in a large suite with all your friends. You'll waste time and your grades will drop, but who cares? When it's all said and done, you'll look back and wish you could do it all over again. ",

The room is pretty much highly symmetrical; the four singles are essentially identical and the common room and the double are as well.\r\n\r\nThe singles are by no means huge, but are quite sufficient to live comfortably.  Also, we didn't have an issue with too-thin walls.  I found them adequate; you're more liable to hear through the standard dorm doors than the walls.  The double is somewhat unusually shaped, but is pretty big.  As stated in the previous review, the common room is somewhat small for 6, but we made do just fine and fit in many more on two futons--I think putting the TV(s) in the fireplace area maximizes the number of seats.\r\n\r\n408 was also great for parties given the number of rooms and hallway.

The pair in the double on the lower level of the suite should be people who go to sleep the latest and who don't mind noise because it opens out right into the common room.\r\n2. If you're reading this review as a pre-frosh, try to figure out who's rooming with whom before getting on campus. It makes moving in a lot easier if everyone already knows who their roommate is and which room they're going to live in. Plus, this way you'll avoid any roommate incompatabilities later in the year. This worked out so well for us that all three of the double pairs in this suite are staying with their roommate for next year. \r\n3. Lighting is pretty terrible. Be prepared to buy lamps, lots of them.\r\n4. It'll take trial and error to figure out a cleaning schedule that works. Be patient with one another.\r\n\r\nAll in all, rejoice if you get this suite.

The dorm is very cushy: elevator, kitchens, multiple laundry rooms, study spaces all within a short distance of the room. It is very quiet all the time. It overlooks Poe field and is close to Mol Bio classes and Lot 23. Believe it or not, it's about the same distance from the street as Brown, though of course it's uphill to get to meals. It takes 5 min to get to frist, and takes me less than 10 to get to the street. \r\n\r\nThe downside is that scully is pretty quiet, which is nice when sleeping or studying, but can get old if you don't venture out.\r\n\r\nIt's been really comfortable living here.

The other bedroom feels like prison: bunked beds, one desk, one dresser... and let me tell you, having your desk or dresser in the common room is a royal pain in the ass!\r\n\r\nBesides that? Adjustable heat that works is a plus! Amazing view of the courtyard! Fabulous bay window! And the common room is very, very spacious. We had a nice little soiree that was able to host in excess of 30 people. This room can be tons of fun, in the right hands, and with the right roomates. I will say this much, I consider myself to have been a lucky freshman.

Also, the other reviewer is not exaggerating the thin-ness of the walls at all -- in fact, there's a door in the wall between 126 and 125, which lets absolutely EVERY sound through.  We're talking mouse clicks, people.\r\n\r\nOn the bright side, it is close to classes (if you're not an engineer) and Nassau street.  Far from laundry and kitchen, though the women's restroom is just a few doors down.\r\n\r\nHonestly, a nice little single in Scully would be SO much better.",

It is a very clean building in general and new so you don't have to worry about bugs. 330 is a great location on the 3rd floor: garbage disposal is at one end of the hall, computer cluster is at the other end, and the elevator is somewhere in between, which means moving in and out is simple.\r\n\r\nA note about 330 itself: the previous resident really went to town on the walls and there are a lot of holes, pencil markings and stains on the walls.

The single is small and has lots of strange angles (and no closet- just rods across one area), but it's cosy and has enough room to put a desk in it.. The double is huge, plenty of room to de-bunk the beds (which we did),  or put desks in there if you'd rather. The common room is a little small, but has lots of character with a nice window seat and fireplace. You look right out across the slums, which is a nice view. The bathrooms are right down the hall (guys about 10 feet away, girls about 30 feet). About the only complaint I have is the heating. Each bedroom has 1 radiator, and the common room has 1 huge ugly one. You have a little control over the one in the common room, but so far this year the heat has either been on full blast or not at all.

Definitely capable of large parties if you're into it.  Walls are made of concrete/stone and not too susceptible to nailing.  Lighting isn't too great despite windows on 2 walls, because of the way the room is oriented.  Heating (like in most of the slums) is by hand adjusting valves on wall-side boilers.\r\n\r\nThe real issue is that the bedroom is TINY -- as a triple this year, we could not fit the 3rd bed in the room even after bunking 2 beds, and the 3rd roommate had to resort to piling up mattresses stolen from the hallway.  It'll work much better as a double, although the dimensions of the room compared to the bed frames would still require either bunking or moving one bed into the common room.  There is one built-in closet in the bedroom, and 2 out in the common room.\r\n\r\nThere is a private bathroom accessible only by walking through the bedroom.  It works fine other than the occasional drainage problem (Housing responded within the day when I called them up).  Although the little bathroom window is located directly beneath the Henry-Foulke archway, which enables eavesdropping during showers.\r\n\r\nThe room is directly across the hall from an a capella group (the Tigerlilies).  Rehearsals are not loud enough to be annoying, although be prepared for their partying during the post-audition, pre-break, and pre-holiday seasons.

The location can't be beat, and being on the second floor cuts most of the noise of people chatting outside.  If you take this room, I would highly recommend putting your desk in front of the window and the bed by the door because it opens up the space a lot.  It's a small room, but the straight walls make it actually feel more spacious than some of the Brown singles with higher square footage but lots of unusable wall space.

		"content" : "  The rooms are a little small (beds need to be bunked if you plan to have all desks and dressers in the room) but is completely made up for by the fact that we have a gigantic common room with two huge windows with beautiful views. One window we've kept covered with a Pace (Italian for \"peace\") flag so our activities in the room aren't constantly on display. The other window isn't at eye-level so we get a beautiful view, but no one looking in. \r\n  There is no better location on campus. We're first floor, so moving in is a snap. We're closer to Frist than we are to Wilson. There's a computer cluster in nearby 1937. Best of all, laundry is just one flight of stairs down. Being central campus and at the intersection of so many roads, 101 Feinberg is also a great place to meet people, and we have lots of friends stop by the room just because it is on their way to and/or from class, activities, etc.\r\n  The room on the right has significantly more natural light, so if this is a major consideration, keep that in mind. Also, your computers will need to be wireless. The ethernet ports are in strange locations and may not work with the layout you want of the room.\r\n  The one reservation I have about this room is noise. You will get noise of people walking back from the street. Also, Feinberg is a great place for parties, so don't draw into this room if you expect your neighbors to be completely quiet on a Saturday night. Also, the heaters are water heaters that have a propensity for clanking. It worked out great for us because we're all deep sleepers. We weren't bothered by the noise. This is especially important because it sort of defeats the purpose of having such a great common room if one roommate needs absolute quiet when sleeping. If you're a very private person and can't stand the idea of people being able to see into your common room, then it might not be a such a great idea to draw into this room, either.\r\n  However, what are the other perks of this room? Well, there's the prox entry for one. You won't have to carry an extra key with you, you can just prox in! The private bathroom (just make sure you guys are willing to clean it). And, for the 2008-2009 year, your RCAs will be right downstairs in the Fishbowl, so free food and lots of fun whenever you want!\r\n  In all seriousness, visit and see for yourselves. I've loved living here and am actually quite bummed that I can't keep living here. You're a lucky person if you draw into this room!",

The back double (now single) can get overheated. The common room is very spacious and good for entertainingwe fit two couches and a dining room table, and we still had plenty of extra space.

		"content" : "1. This room, being in Joline, is not on par in terms of interior quality with more modern, renovated dorms such as those in Blair, Little, and Hamilton. It has no thermostat, so you'll be completely dependent on the whim of the central heating system, which is excessive in the winter (and loud!). Because it is in the attic (basically), the air quality isn't spectacular -- it is still and somewhat stuffy. While you can alleviate that by opening the window, doing so will invite a consistent stream of bugs into the room. I also noticed a large insect (perhaps a centipede) almost enter the room through the radiator, so I had to seal it up with duct tape.\r\n\r\n2. In terms of noise, the walls are thick and the room is reasonably quiet, even on party nights.\r\n\r\n3. The bathrooms are close by, but they have extremely poor ventilation, and are inconsistently maintained by the janitor. Although they are better than those found in the basement, they are mediocre compared to the spacious and well-ventilated ones found in buildings like Blair.\r\n\r\n4. My roommate and I organized the dorm into two bedrooms, rather than a bedroom and a common room. This arrangement worked great -- although the inner room is very small, it fits everything you need without a problem (bed, desk, refrigerator, bookshelf, television, closet, etc.).\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, if you are drawing in Mathey and would like a two-room double, I strongly recommend 231 Joline. Otherwise, there are better options, especially outside of Mathey (e.g. Scully). Thus, while the room is good, I simply cannot recommend it when compared to the many other options that are significantly superior.",

Being in 115, on the first floor means that you are right next to the printer, study rooms, laundry, men's bathroom, trash chute, and you never really have to walk up stairs. It's really convenient. Also, if you ever lock yourself out of your room or lose your prox, you can always easily climb in the window if you leave them unlocked.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\nThere are a couple things that I found annoying. One is that people smoke outside...a lot. Even when your windows are closed, it can still seep in. Also, there's can be drunk stampeding and loud, obnoxious conversation in the hallway/outside.

The room directly above this one has the exact same layout, and they were able to fit two lovely couches, a TV and coffee table, a card table, a lounge chair, and four smaller table chairs all in this area without it feeling cramped at all. The bedrooms are on the smaller side, so it is difficult to unbunk the beds (but possible, especially if the desks are moved into the common room). The walls are really thick so everything is quiet, and I couldn't hear anything from my neighbors in the building. On occasion, the noise outside the bedroom window (facing 1903) could get a little louder as people walked by on Thursday and Saturday nights, but I'm a really light sleeper and it hardly bothered me. It also has real closets! The courtyard is pretty, and obviously Cuyler has a great location. The downside is that laundry and printer are both in different buildings. 1903's basement laundry room has a rather treacherous stairway outside in the winter, and the printer in Brown was often broken so I usually used the one in Wright. Also, both men's and women's bathrooms are in the basement, but this room is much closer to both than most other rooms in Cuyler, especially the women's. Overall, it was a fantastic room, and I definitely recommend it.",

The floor plan is identical, but it's listed as 503 sq. ft. compared to the 451 for this room.  Basically, the 451 is the total usable space, without the hallway inside the room and the closets.\r\n\r\nThe room itself is great. 1903's location alone makes it worth it, and the common room is pretty spacious.  The room looks over Prospect Garden, so it's quieter overall than the courtyard rooms, although it can still get kind of loud when people are coming back from the Street (though that's true of almost every room in this part of campus).\r\n\r\nThe biggest downside is that there are only two bedrooms, and the double is a little cramped.  There's not enough room to debunk the beds, and there's only one closet in the bedroom, so you'll either have to share or have one person use the third closet in the room's hallway.  You'll also have to have the two desks for the people who live in the double in the common room, though it's large enough that this isn't a problem.  The heat only has two settings (off and hellfire), so you'll probably have to keep your windows open all winter, but again, not really a big deal.\r\n\r\nThere's a women's bathroom right next door, and for the men's room, you can either go up or down a flight of stairs or down the hall to the 2nd entryway.  1903 has a laundry room in the basement.\r\n\r\nWe got this room during mixed-class draw last year.

It isn't the biggest quad you will find on campus but that being said, we fit bunked beds, 2 dressers and 2 desks in each bedroom, with the closets provided in each bedroom and still had some walking space (though not much). You could unbunk the beds and put your desks in the common room if you wanted but we liked having the common room as a comfortable living room space. In the common room, we had 2 sofas, a coffee table, a refrigerator, 3 bookshelves, a tv and a study/eating table with 2 chairs. You just have to get creative with the furniture but we have lots of furniture and still lots of empty space. \r\n\r\nThe room is located very up-campus but that was my favorite part of 112 Hamilton. Nassau Street is extremely accessible. The UStore is  a 2 minute walk, the Rocky-Mathey library is just 2 steps outside of Hamilton and great for studying and printing. Laundry room is right downstairs which is nice, and the Mathey Common Room is too (which is GREAT for getting in line for weekly study breaks or Broadway tickets early in the mornings).  Hamilton is connected to the RoMa Dining Hall so this winter when it was freeeeezing cold or there was 2 feet of snow on the ground, we didn't have to bundle up to walk to eat which was AMAZING. The only annoying thing is that the boys and girls bathrooms are upstairs but its not a dealbreaker. Thermostats in every room and great views of the Rocky tower from the common room. The Hamilton Courtyard is so peaceful and idyllic-we often see little rabbits running around and hear birds chirping, it feels like we are in a fairytale sometimes and when its warm outside, tons of couples take wedding pictures outside of your window. Hamilton is recently renovated too so the hallways are wood paneled and nice to come home too.\r\n\r\nIn summary, beautiful room, excellent location! I will definitely miss this room.",

There's a closet that's like a big wooden box  built into the wall, and you can hang stuff inside and there's also shelving inside so you can stack clothes. There's room for a comfy chair but probably not a futon or couch  unless you got really creative.

Maybe Forbes sprayed for them or something? \r\n\r\nOverall though, a solid draw when coupled with 306 for you and a buddy.

As long as you're careful about crumbs and keeping your food tightly closed, it is manageable. \r\n\r\nOne of the main problems about the room, however, is that one room is significantly smaller than the other. Both are actually about the same square feet - except one is extremely narrow. At only 5-6 feet wide, there's no way to un-bunk the beds without hitting the two dressers and shelves in the process. The other bad part about the smaller bedroom room is that there really isn't much of a closet. Both rooms have dressers with five drawers, but they're pretty shallow drawers. Eventually, you decide that you need to hang up some clothes...and then you see a small alcove divided into 2 parts with 2 closet rods. The rods are literally less than 1.5' per person. Try not to bring too much stuff if you can avoid it (plus it's three floors up - no elevator). The bigger bedroom has four closet rods a lot more space for clothing.\r\n\r\nThere's not much lighting either so be prepared to bring a bright desk lamp.\r\n\r\nIn general, the room is  pretty central in Wilson. A lot of people are coming and going through this area (because it's so close to the dining hall). If the windows are open, it gets a little noisy.",

It was very sturdy and worked out extremely well and we still had access to the majority of the window seat.\r\n\r\nThere is a bathroom on the bottom floor - however it is a bit of a long walk (it's by entryway 1 whereas this room is entryway 4). The men's bathroom is slightly closer (entryway 3).

I really loved having the window shades open but people walking by are only two feet away from your window and can definitely see straight in. However being on the bottom floor does have its perks in the summer time when you leave your windows open and forgot your prox - you can just climb in your window!\r\n\r\nThough it's not the biggest, it is a great room overall.

The bedrooms in this room are TINY. you basically can't debunk the beds, unless you are ok with your bed touching your roommate's bed. One of the bedrooms does have a bay window though, which is a nice place to put your desk. the common room is a good size, but it is awkwardly shaped. there are two fairly large closets, but there are only 3 bars for hanging clothes (2 in one and 1 in the other), so someone doesn't get to hang their clothes. Also, the closets are extremely awkwardly shaped and don't have any light source (and there are no outlets inside), so it's really hard to see inside when you're looking for something. On the topic of outlets, this room is SEVERELY lacking in outlets: each bedroom only has 1, and the common room only has 2 (on opposite sides of the room). We ended up using literally around a dozen extension cords to get everything plugged in in somewhere where it could be used. Also the room gets unbearably hot in the winter, and the windows must be left open basically all the time, except if you have your desk near a window, in which case no matter how much you close the window it's still going to be freezing because the windows are very poorly insulated. The floors are also in really bad condition, with large gaps between some of the tiles--stuff (e.g. vomit) gets stuck in them and are really hard to get out. The room is quite far from bathrooms: you either have to go up one flight of stairs and down a long hallway to use a tiny, poorly ventilated, rarely cleaned bathroom, or down two flights of stairs to use a larger basement bathroom that is perpetually in a state of sustained filth. Basically, avoid this room like the plague.\r\n\r\nIt is however a decent party room, since it is quite far from the RCA room (on a different floor and down a long hallway) and is already in terrible condition so parties can't make it any worse anyway.

Second, unlike the previous reviewer I did have enough space for all my clothes (and I have quite a bit too). Proximity to newly-renovated girl's bathroom is also a plus for females. Closet is decent sized too.\r\n\r\nOn the negative end: the room is hot-dog shaped, all your furniture has to be on the same side of the wall. There's a little nook you can shove your dresser into but that's about it. I put my bed on risers (but not lofted) and was able to cram my fridge, laundry, and other stuff under it, good space saver. The room can also get quite hot, but opening the window usually takes care of that (hope you don't have allergies). Lighting is not great at all, but the window actually lets in quite a bit of light and if you bring a lamp you'll be fine. The only other non-size related issue with it goes along with proximity to the bathroom -- the stalls next door are super spring-loaded, so although you can't hear people going to the bathroom or anything (thank god), if people let the doors slam back it will often bounce several times and shake the walls in the process.\r\n\r\nOverall,\r\n\r\nPROS: LOCATION, proximity to newly renovated bathrooms, laundry/printer in building, kitchen down the hall, big ENOUGH to live in but not to do much else\r\n\r\nCONS: size and shape, slamming bathroom doors, dim lighting, gets pretty hot without window\r\n\r\nrecommendation: get this room and be close to friends with a triple or quad next door, and get the janitor to clip a couple of springs on those stupid bathroom doors",

In that sense it was a \"walk-through\" closet.  Each side (one for each of us) had a long hanging rod, a shelf up above, and was deep enough to stash stuff easily (the shelf was high and thus perfect for rarely accessed storage).  The bathroom was nice (I mean who can complain about a private bath?), and I particularly enjoyed the fact that it featured a tub, not just a shower stall.  Another nice thing; it had a REAL glass mirror, not one of those polished metal failed attempts at a mirror.\r\n\r\nI think this room is usually assigned to freshman, but if it is ever up for draw, definitely consider it if you want a reasonably spacious (there are definitely bigger out there) double in a nice location with a good private bathroom.",

First of all it's in Forbes, which means your walk back from campus at night is greeted with mental institution hallways and a dimly-lit room with cinderblock walls. It is the absolute minimum size for a double (90sf per person). I had friends in the other side of the annex who had SINGLES that were bigger. We bunked our beds, but it is still difficult to navigate the room. The window faces the north, which means you get no natural light and the room is very dim. The awkward position of the window and placement of the fire sprinklers meant that there was only one place in the room where our bed could go. Also, we couldn't put stuff on top of our closets because of the sprinklers. Oh, and dump trucks come every morning to wake you up. You can also hear everything your neighbors are saying through the walls...Thank god I had a lovely roommate who also kept things very clean—otherwise I would have gone insane. If you have the misfortune of drawing this room, bunk your beds, vacuum frequently, make friends with someone on campus who has a common room and spend all your time there. ",

There is an awkward fireplace mantle that can prevent this.\r\n-There are a lot of house centipedes during the warm months. They usually disappear by late October and this is common to most Rocky rooms if not more.\r\n-Noise from the music room: the room rests on top of the music room in the basement and you are guaranteed to hear whatever plays down there. However, I personally have not had a problem with it in the bedroom and attempting to sleep.\r\n-Noise from the dumpster: EVERY morning, the dump truck comes by around 9:30-11:00 am to empty the dumpsters on the side of Witherspoon. This involves a good 5-10 minutes of loud metal clashing and banging. If you are not a heavy sleeper, this is your alarm clock because the dumpster is right there\r\n-Visibility: with the curtains up, most adjacent 03 quads can see what's up in your room\r\n-Being on the first floor is quite convenient for the printer, kitchen, and exits\r\n-Bathrooms: in the 2014-2015 year, the adjacent bathroom was women's and unfortunately we (men) were not able to change it, so we had to walk across the hall to use the bathroom\r\n\r\nAll that being said, if you are being faced with the choice between this last turret room and ANY other quad in Rocky, I strongly advise that you pick this room.",

Once it started to warm up they fixed it and it broke again a few days later. There is a large gap under the door, so when the window is open and it is windy there is a whooshing sound. One wall is shared with the women's bathroom, and the doors on the stalls in there automatically slam shut, which you will hear at all hours of the day. To get to the men's bathroom you either have to go up one floor and across the building or go outside on the same floor. In general, the room is small and feels small.\r\n\r\nPositive: If you're a girl the bathroom is right next door. It's on the first floor so you don't have any flights of stairs to go up. The laundry room is just three doors down so it's very convenient.",

		"content" : "A bit smaller than square footage implies because there are two pointless steps once you walk in where you can't really do anything with. Cannot fit desks in bedrooms. Desks more comfortably fit in common room. Once desks are in common room, you can probably fit a fridge or a chair (but most likely not both). More comfortable to bunk beds than debunk. No bathroom on the same floor but there is one directly below and above you. Printer cluster directly below you. Close proximity to u-store by going out basement entryways. Laundry is downstairs, down the hall. The dorm room is immediately to your left when you walk in through entryway 4...plus, it's Little so great location overall. But if doing work in common room, you can often hear the entryway door open and close every now and then, and since you're on the 1st floor, people can pretty easily see into your window, especially at night...just something to keep in mind. Generally not too noisy though, since there's only 3 rooms on your floor. Not too many public places to hangout/study. There's a bench table for 2-3 people immediately downstairs (where the printer is) and a few couches/a larger table to work at near the laundry room. Rated 4 mostly for convenience of amenities (laundry, printer, ustore, dillon gym, etc).",

The room is also just kind of dark and dingy in general so get lots of lamps/lights. The bathroom is huge, but it's also bare so you'll definitely need some shelves in there and in the shower. Also the shower head is weird so you can't hang a caddy over it; a tension corner shelf works better. Once you get all situated, I think you'll love this room.

And it was a perfectly serviceable room.\r\n\r\nA few things to keep in mind, which seem to be problems for Cuyler in general\r\n- The heating/cooling was a little bit delayed, so when the weather is oscillating in the spring they would turn off the heat, it gets cold and you freeze, then they turn on the heat just in time for the weather to get warm and you cook a little bit. It wasn't that bad, but if you are sensitive to temperature it is something to keep in mind. \r\n- The windows weren't soundproof, which meant you could hear all the nearby parties and events in Dillon. I invested in some earplugs and it worked fine.\r\n\r\nAnd things about this room specifically:\r\n- Plan out how you will divide up the single/double early on. We did 1/3 of the year for each person, but you might have different ideas. Anyways, best to figure it out early on and avoid anger and hurt feelings when it ends up being whoever gets to campus first takes the single all year.",

Positives are that this part of the building has fairly easy access to the Main Inn and the Annex laundry room. You still have a nice view of the golf course/grad college and there's less activity in this area. With all of the furniture on the walls there was a surprising amount of space in the middle of the room, but by no means is this room spacious. Negatives are that it's inconvenient to go to throughout the day; but you must already know that as a Forbesian.

You will have to go outside and into the second half of the building to access the garbage shoot, but thats not too inconvenient if you take it out in shifts every week. The room itself has two bedrooms and a common room, yet it is surprisingly spacious. Don't expect to do too much decorating though in the bedroom, especially if you came from a single or double where you had more space for cute things. Beds are bunked and can't be unbunked. I'd say stick to simplicity and this room will work out fine. The bedroom that is to the right of the door is the best one because it has two armoires and two drawer units. The one directly straight ahead of the entrance is unfortunate because it has two bars for hanging clothes, but they're out in the open. The room still has two drawer units though. I would say people with the most stuff should have the room to the right. The common room is a nice size for living and doing day to day things. Its a good postgame room, maybe not a good pregame room. We have a couch and table in addition to the desks. One issue is that there is not an outlet for every desk. If you have the desk closest to the door of the bedroom to the right of the entrance, be prepared to run an extension cord/powerstrip along the floor so you can have a place to plug in your electronics. Also, being on the first floor means that if you want privacy, you're gonna have to keep the shade down on those bedroom windows.

No one really pregames here. \r\n\r\nCons: It's hot. The heat is for some reason really high. Three flights of stairs every time you leave. Because it's the island the 2nd/3rd floors don't connect to the rest of the annex. The nearest kitchen is kinda far. The cold air isn't really that effective in the heat. The wall is slanted on one side. \r\n\r\nAll in all, if you are reading this you are probably at the bottom of the draw time like I was.

The stairs lead to the 4th floor (the room is on the 5th floor of Holder), where there's just a door leading to the hallway.

Closest men's bathroom is on the 3rd floor, and closest women's bathroom is on the 2nd floor. Elevator only goes from entrance 2A of Holder up to the third floor - you have to take the stairs the rest of the way.

We called maintenance to fix it, but they apparently can't do anything about it and we were told not to have food in our room which was incredibly annoying. There are swarms of them in every nook and cranny, literally thousands.\r\n\r\nThe bathroom nearby is also disgusting. I'm pretty sure maintenance only cleans it once a month because someone once threw up all over the toilet and it wasn't cleaned for weeks. The sinks sometimes all fill up with mysterious liquid. We also had a sewer fly infestation in our showers. Imagine pulling back the shower curtain and seeing 100 fat flies. \r\n\r\nPros:\r\nF$cking none, the common room is pretty big I guess\r\n\r\nTL;DR It is hard to distinguish this room from a third world country",

If you stay up late doing work and look outside around 4am, you'll usually see deer grazing! You can also hear birds chirping often, which can be good or bad. It's very relaxing and gives you the feeling of a high quality of life, if that makes sense. I love coming back to my room at the end of the day or even right after class.\r\n\r\nCONS: LOTS of bugs. This part of the annex is known for having stinkbugs. I probably run into one, dead or alive, at least every other week, although they're easy to deal with. I've found a dead stinkbug in my coat pocket before. I've also had a cockroach run out from under my blanket, which was traumatic. Also, the view onto the golf course comes at a price, since it can be pretty noisy. Lots of golf carts and grass mowers, especially on weekend mornings when I try to sleep in.

The AC vents switch to heating vents after fall break, so be patient, there will be heat eventually. However you don't have full control of it, I believe there's a built in thermostat somewhere, because heating shuts off at a certain temperature, so it didn't always get fully toasty when you want it to.

I had a queen-size bed and ample room for a couch and a rug. Laundry is on the same floor as well.\r\n\r\nOn nights out it can get a little bit loud outside because the window faces the walk to the Wa, and there will always be people there. You're also next to the Murley Tower, and there's a huge chance there will be pregames there on nights out. It's also just a little bit too far from the showers, but not quite so far that it's a real inconvenience. The room is VERY dark, except in the afternoon. \r\n\r\nOverall, really big, but kind of dark and too far from the showers. \r\n",

Biiig Long windows, so you can get quite a bit of sunlight when it's sunny outside. Also you get a shared bathroom + a shared shower and bathroom!\r\nDisadvantages: Being located by the YES arch means everyone walks by your room. You might wanna have your blinds down at night if you have the lights on cause people see straight into your room. We've never been busted while throwing a pregame, although it is possible because of the location. It goes without saying, but there's NO PRIVACY, so your sex life will likely suffer, and so will your circadian rhythm. This room used to be a classroom, so it comes with the shitty gray classroom carpeting and the incredibly bright classroom style lights, which is a minor but palpable drawback.\r\nThat being said, we did throw some SICK pregames, which made up for a lot of the drawbacks.

We could only have 2 people besides ourselves in the room at a time, but so many friends who I have had over for tea throughout the semester commented on how amazing the room is as a single.  **Key feature** though is definitely the giant bay windows / little semi-circle. It lets in tons of amazing natural light- especially in the morning which is great if you are like me and have a hard time waking up. I moved my desk in there and friends called it my \"control room\" because it's like a whole set up with a big calendar and books on two of the three window sills, and then left one open to sit in-- my favorite space on campus to read/have isolated meals etc. \r\n\r\nAll that ranting to say, in my situation this room was amazing and if you can get it as a single definitely do!

The radiator is a godsend when it gets cold in the winter but a nuisance when the weather warms up, at which point you'll either need to crack open a window or use a box fan. The room surprisingly has very few bugs, most of which are very small, and no cockroaches at all, even though they are known to live in 1903. There is a decent amount of noise from outside besides noise from the nearby entryway (but a loud enough fan will drown out all noise). \r\n\r\n1903 is about as centrally-located as you can get on campus, and this room is well-located within 1903: it's right near an entryway right below both a men's and women's bathroom, and about as close to Frist as you can get in upperclass housing. The courtyard is a great place to hang out in 1903 during the warmer months if you have friends living in the same dorm. Laundry is only accessible from outside on the other end of the building, but unless the weather is awful it's a bearable walk. \r\n\r\nOverall, if you're willing to trade AC and quiet for room size and location, this room is a good fit.\r\n\r\nSome extra notes:\r\n- There is a water stain on the floor on one end of the room from what appears to have been a leak from the bathroom above and a burn mark on the floor near the radiator.
